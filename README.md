# CSS 3D Flipping Trading Card

## Intro

This project is a virtual trading card with 3-D flipping effect on hover, revealing more information about the featured character, using Dungeons and Dragons, Magic: The Gathering and other tabletop games as inspiration. The card also functions on hover-disabled devices, using an alternate single-sided layout.

## Images

The image of the character featured on the trading card was created by [Sarah Lopez](https://www.instagram.com/inkcap_creations/) in colored pencil and watercolor, then digitized and edited. I am using it with her permission.

The spiral vector graphics were created by myself using Adobe Illustrator.
